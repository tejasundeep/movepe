# Deployment Plan for Prisma Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for deploying the application after migrating from JSON file storage to Prisma ORM. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition with minimal downtime and risk.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Readiness
- [ ] All services and API routes updated to use Prisma
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Database Readiness
- [ ] Database schema finalized
- [ ] Migrations tested
- [ ] Data migration scripts prepared
- [ ] Database backup strategy in place

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] Production environment configured for Prisma
- [ ] Database servers provisioned and configured
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Monitoring tools set up

### Operational Readiness
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] On-call schedule established

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Database Migration

1. **Backup Current Data**
   - Take a full backup of the current JSON files
   - Store backups in a secure location

2. **Create Production Database**
   - Set up the production database server
   - Apply schema migrations
   - Configure access controls and security

3. **Migrate Data**
   - Run data migration scripts
   - Verify data integrity
   - Perform data validation checks

### 2. Application Deployment

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify functionality with migrated data
   - Perform load testing

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Schedule deployment during low-traffic period
   - Notify users of planned maintenance
   - Deploy application in blue-green deployment model
   - Gradually shift traffic to new version

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical functionality
   - Monitor performance and error rates
   - Check database connection pool

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- Critical functionality not working
- Significant performance degradation
- Data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities

### Rollback Process
1. Revert to previous application version
2. Switch database connection back to JSON files
3. Notify users of the rollback
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Reschedule deployment

## Monitoring and Support

### Monitoring
- Database performance metrics
- API response times
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Support
- Dedicated support team during and after deployment
- Escalation path for critical issues
- Regular status updates to stakeholders

## Timeline

### Week 1: Preparation
- Finalize code changes
- Complete testing
- Prepare production environment

### Week 2: Deployment
- Day 1: Database migration
- Day 2: Staging deployment and testing
- Day 3: Production deployment
- Day 4-5: Monitoring and support

### Week 3: Stabilization
- Monitor performance
- Address any issues
- Optimize as needed

## Communication Plan

### Pre-Deployment
- Notify all stakeholders of deployment schedule
- Communicate expected downtime
- Provide details on new features or changes

### During Deployment
- Regular status updates
- Immediate notification of any issues
- Clear communication of progress

### Post-Deployment
- Deployment summary
- Performance metrics
- User feedback collection

## Success Criteria

1. Application is fully functional with Prisma
2. Performance meets or exceeds previous version
3. No data loss or corruption
4. Minimal user impact during transition

## Conclusion

This deployment plan provides a structured approach to deploying the migrated application. By following this plan, we can ensure a smooth transition to Prisma with minimal risk and disruption.

# Testing Plan for Prisma Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for verifying the successful migration from JSON file storage to Prisma ORM. The goal is to ensure that all functionality works correctly with the new database layer.

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual service methods and storage utilities
- **Tools**: Jest
- **Focus**: Verify that each method correctly interacts with Prisma

#### Key Areas to Test:

- CRUD operations for each entity
- Error handling
- Edge cases (empty results, large datasets)
- Transaction handling

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Scope**: API routes and service interactions
- **Tools**: Supertest, Jest
- **Focus**: Verify that API routes correctly use services and return expected responses

#### Key Areas to Test:

- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Error handling

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **Scope**: Complete user flows
- **Tools**: Cypress
- **Focus**: Verify that the application works correctly from a user perspective

#### Key Flows to Test:

- User registration and login
- Order creation and management
- Vendor quote submission and selection
- Rider assignment and delivery tracking
- Payment processing
- Review submission

### 4. Performance Testing

- **Scope**: Database operations and API response times
- **Tools**: JMeter, Lighthouse
- **Focus**: Verify that the application meets performance requirements

#### Key Metrics to Measure:

- Response time for common operations
- Database query performance
- Concurrent user handling
- Resource utilization

### 5. Data Validation

- **Scope**: Database integrity
- **Tools**: Custom scripts
- **Focus**: Verify that data was migrated correctly

#### Key Checks:

- Record counts match between old and new systems
- Data integrity (no missing or corrupted records)
- Relationships are maintained
- Constraints are enforced

## Test Environments

1. **Development**: Initial testing during development
2. **Staging**: Pre-production testing with production-like data
3. **Production**: Verification after deployment

## Test Data

- Use a combination of:
  - Migrated production data (anonymized)
  - Generated test data for edge cases
  - Manually created test cases for specific scenarios

## Test Schedule

1. **Unit Tests**: Run during development and on every commit
2. **Integration Tests**: Run daily and before each release
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Run before each release
4. **Performance Tests**: Run weekly and before each release
5. **Data Validation**: Run after migration and before production deployment

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All tests pass with at least 90% code coverage
2. No critical or high-severity bugs
3. Performance meets or exceeds baseline measurements
4. Data integrity is maintained

## Reporting

- Generate test reports after each test run
- Track test coverage over time
- Document and prioritize any issues found
- Provide regular status updates to stakeholders

## Responsibilities

- **Developers**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **QA Team**: End-to-end tests and performance tests
- **Database Team**: Data validation
- **DevOps**: Test environment setup and maintenance

## Contingency Plan

If critical issues are found:
1. Revert to JSON file storage if necessary
2. Fix issues in a development environment
3. Re-test thoroughly
4. Deploy fixes to production

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to verifying the successful migration to Prisma. By following this plan, we can ensure that the application works correctly and meets all requirements.
